42. A unsorted array of integers is given you need to find the
    max product formed by multiplying three numbers.(You can not
    sort the array, watch out when there are negative numbers)
    array[]={2,5,-2,6,-3,8,0,-7,-9,4}

52. How to find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be 
    represented as sum of any subset of a given array? You have given a 
    sorted array(sorted in non-decreasing order) of positive numbers. find 
    the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of 
    elements of any subset of given set. What makes it more challenging is 
    expected time complexity of O(N).

    Examples: Input = {1,3,6,10,11,15}
              Output = 2
